# RESTful Web API with Node.js Framework

> This project introduces you to the fundamentals of web APIs with Node.js frameworks. Using your own private blockchain to create a web API is a huge first step toward developing your own web applications that are consumable by a variety of web clients. 


> For this project, youâ€™ll build a RESTful API using a Node.js framework that will interface with the [private blockchain!](https://github.com/KushalGH/private_blockchain_leveldb). 


## STEP 1:  SELECT Node.JS framework
> Created basic hello world using ExpressJS, SailsJS and HapiJs [Link](https://github.com/KushalGH/webservices_nodeJS)

> Reason I have selected SailsJs is:
- Sails makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps.
- Sails is the most popular MVC framework for Node.js

## Step 2: Configure API Service (SAILS.JS)
> Steps to install Sails.js
```
mkdir sailsapi
cd sailsapi
npm init
sails new api-project
cd api-project
sails lift
```
